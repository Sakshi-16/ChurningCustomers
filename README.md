# ChurningCustomers
This model will predict customers that are likely to leave our business. 

Considering the business problem, we can state that we need a better recall score. 

Why?
It's more important to increase True Positives (Predticting Churning customers correctly) and decrease False Negatives (Predicting Churning as Non-churning). 

Till now, from a dataset with only 16% as churned customers, I have managed to get a recall score of 86%.
